# Shopping Cart App Using Redux Toolkit

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using React and Redux Toolkit. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate how to centralize state management using Redux Toolkit.

## Features

- Add items to the shopping cart
- Remove items from the shopping cart
- Reset the shopping cart

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: An official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- React Router: A routing library for React applications.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
- React Icons: A library of popular icons for React applications.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure with the addition of Redux Toolkit for managing the global state of the application.

- **src/components:** Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **src/redux/slices:** Contains Redux slice files, which define the state and logic for individual parts of the Redux store.
- **src/App.js:** The main component that renders the application layout and routes.
- **src/index.js:** The entry point of the application where the React app is initialized.

## CSS Styling

This project does not focus much on CSS styling, as the primary emphasis is on demonstrating the implementation of Redux Toolkit for state management. Therefore, the styling is kept minimal and basic.
